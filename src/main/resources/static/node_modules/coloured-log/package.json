  "readme": "# coloured-log\n\nThis project combines two projects:\n[coloured](http://github.com/gf3/coloured)\nand\n[log.js](http://github.com/visionmedia/log.js).\nIt extends the functionality provided by `log.js` and colourizes your logs\nusing `coloured`.\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install coloured-log\n\n## Examples\n\nSince `coloured-log` simply extends functionality provided by `log.js`, you\ncan use it just as you would use `log.js` normally.\n\nThe following code:\n\n    var Log = require('coloured-log')\n      , log = new Log(Log.DEBUG)\n    \n    log.emergency('Site just went down!');\n    log.alert('Cannot connect to datastore!');\n    log.critical('Request timeout');\n    log.error('Exception thrown by controller');\n    log.warning('Couldn\\'t find the user\\'s session');\n    log.notice('Viewname wasn\\'t defined');\n    log.info('Connected to database');\n    log.debug('Hello World');\n\n...will output something like this:\n\n![Example Logging](http://v3n.us/403507afa606f9e59228e54bb74c0c7d.png)\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nThanks to\n[TJ Holowaychuk](http://github.com/visionmedia)\nand\n[Gianni Chiappetta](http://github.com/gf3)\nfor making beautifully crafted softwares.\n\n## License\n\nThis is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.\n\nAnyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or\ndistribute this software, either in source code form or as a compiled\nbinary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any\nmeans.\n\nIn jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author or authors\nof this software dedicate any and all copyright interest in the\nsoftware to the public domain.
