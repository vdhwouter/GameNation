  "readme": "# Pulverizr\n\nPulverizr will smash your images down to size. It uses a number of free, and\noften times open source, programs to optimize and compress image files while\nstill retaining their original appearance.\n\nWhile modern image editor's, like Photoshop's, compressors do a decent job at\ncutting the extra fat around images, they sometimes leave behind extras you\nprobably don't want or need. For example, EXIF data in JPEGs, color-correction\ndata in PNGs and redundant frames in GIFs.\n\nPulverizr uses a handful of compressors to perform a number of lossless\ncompression routines to squeeze every last bit out of your images (see\n**Dependencies**). Note this software isn't 100% stable yet. You may notice\ndifferences in images that may contain certain color profiles that can be\nstripped out by the compressors. Any strangeness you see, [please report\nit](http://github.com/bentruyman/pulverizr/issues)!\n\nPulverizr is completely written in JavaScript intended to run in a\n[NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) environment. This means any idiot front-end\ndeveloper such as myself can pick up the code and easily understand what's\ngoing on. Also, any normal developer could also pick it up and fix all the\nmistakes I made.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nIf you're on Ubuntu, almost all of these dependencies can be retrieved using\n**apt**. Although Pulverizr works best with all its dependencies, it will\ngracefully fail when it doesn't find a compressor it's looking for.\n\nThe compressors Pulverizr uses are admittedly a bit obscure and sometimes\ndifficult to install on all platforms.\n\n* [gifsicle](http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/) 1.58+\n* [libjpeg](http://www.ijg.org/) (or **libjpeg-progs** if you're using\n  **apt**)\n* [optipng](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/) 0.6.3+\n* [pngcrush](http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/) 1.7.0+\n\n### On Mac OSX\n\nIf you're using [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), install the\nfollowing packages:\n\n    brew install gifsicle libjpeg optipng pngcrush\n\n### On Ubuntu\n\nTo install the dependencies on Ubuntu:\n\n    apt-get install gifsicle libjpeg-progs optipng pngcrush\n\n### On Windows\n\nGood luck to you, fine sir.\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install -g pulverizr\n\n## Usage\n\n**Note: Be sure to test before you overwrite your images by using `--dry-run`**\n\nUsage: pulverize [options] <file...>\n\n    Options:\n\n      -h, --help        output usage information\n      -V, --version     output the version number\n      -a, --aggressive  Uses more aggressive compression algorithms (takes longer, works better)\n      --dry-run         Print summary but don't actually modify files\n      -q, --quiet       Pulverizer will not report\n      -R, --recursive   Recurse through directories\n      -v, --verbose     Verbose mode\n\n### Single File\n\n    pulverize image.png\n    \n### Single Directory\n\n    pulverize /var/www/mysite.com/images/products/backgrounds\n\n### Multiple Files\n\n    pulverize foo.png bar.png baz.png qux.png\n\n### Recursive Directory\n\n    pulverize -R -- /var/www/mysite.com/images\n\n### Aggressive Recursive Directory\n\n    pulverize -aR -- /var/www/mysite.com/images\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nSee **Dependencies**, and [Smush.it](http://smush.it)\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2010, Benjamin Truyman\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n   notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n   notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n   documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n * Neither the name of the owner nor the names of its contributors may be\n   used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without\n   specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND\nANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.
